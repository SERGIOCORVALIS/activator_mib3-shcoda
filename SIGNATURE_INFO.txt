IMPORTANT SIGNATURE INFORMATION
===============================

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
The activation.sh.sig file contains a STUB (zero bytes).
A PROPER SIGNATURE is required for activator operation!

SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------------
- File size: 4096 bytes
- Format: Depends on LG MEN3 signature system
- Algorithm: Probably RSA or ECDSA
- Key: Private key required for signing

HOW TO OBTAIN SIGNATURE:
-----------------------
1. Study LG MEN3 signature system
2. Find a way to generate signatures for ScriptInstaller
3. Use the same method used for other scripts in firmware
4. Replace activation.sh.sig with proper signature

ALTERNATIVE METHODS:
--------------------
1. Use signature from existing script (if format is compatible)
2. Study signature verification bypass mechanism (if exists)
3. Use tools for working with LG MEN3 firmware

IMPORTANT:
----------
Without proper signature, the activation.sh script WILL NOT BE EXECUTED by the system!
Current stub is used only for file structure.

SIGNATURE VERIFICATION:
-----------------------
After obtaining proper signature:
1. Replace activation.sh.sig
2. Update CheckSum in installer.txt (SHA256 hash of file)
3. Update CheckSum in script.module/1.0.0.mnf
